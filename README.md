In this project, I designed a large-scale enterprise network architecture using Cisco Packet Tracer that integrates multiple advanced networking technologies. The project follows a three-tier architecture with core, distribution, and access layers, ensuring scalability, redundancy, and high availability across the network. The topology encompasses a variety of services such as voice, video, IoT, and data, all working in tandem to serve both enterprise users and external customers.

Each network segment is designed with specific routing protocols, access control, and security features, making the overall system resilient and efficient. Key technologies implemented include OSPF, EIGRP, Static Routing, and RIP for dynamic and static routing, DHCP and DNS for IP address management and name resolution, EtherChannel for link aggregation, VLANs for network segmentation, STP for loop prevention, NAT for public-private IP translation, ACL for traffic filtering, and VoIP for unified communications. A 4G Cellular Tower connects IoT and mobile devices to the network, offering robust connectivity for remote areas.
