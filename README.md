The project represents a complex enterprise network that connects a branch to a central Headquarters (HQ). In this project, I designed a large-scale enterprise network architecture using Cisco Packet Tracer that integrates multiple advanced networking technologies. The project follows a three-tier architecture with core, distribution, and access layers, ensuring scalability, redundancy, and high availability across the network. The topology encompasses a variety of services such as voice, video, IoT, and data, all working in tandem to serve both enterprise users and external customers.

Each network segment is designed with specific routing protocols, access control, and security features, making the overall system resilient and efficient. Key technologies implemented include OSPF, EIGRP, Static Routing, and RIP for dynamic and static routing, DHCP and DNS for IP address management and name resolution, EtherChannel for link aggregation, VLANs for network segmentation, STP for loop prevention, NAT for public-private IP translation, ACL for traffic filtering, and VoIP for unified communications. A 4G Cellular Tower connects IoT and mobile devices to the network, offering robust connectivity for remote areas.

The key goals of this network design are to provide:

Efficient inter-branch communication using OSPF and EIGRP.
Seamless communication for end devices across multiple VLANs.
Reliable voice and video communication using VoIP.
Secure network access using ACL and NAT for external traffic.
Connectivity for IoT devices and 4G cellular services to support real-time monitoring.
High network availability and redundancy using STP and EtherChannel.
Key Features of the Design:
Three-Tier Architecture:

Core Layer: High-speed routing between HQ and branches using OSPF as the backbone protocol.
Distribution Layer: OSPF and EIGRP deployed to ensure efficient routing and policy-based traffic filtering between different branches.
Access Layer: VLAN segmentation at each branch to isolate different departments, ensuring security and traffic optimization.
Routing Technologies:

OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is used to connect the branches to the HQ, ensuring fast convergence and scalability in dynamic routing.
EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) is used within each branch for inter-VLAN routing and load balancing.
Static Routing is used to direct traffic between critical internal servers and services.
RIP Routing is applied for legacy support to connect older devices that do not support OSPF or EIGRP.
Layer 2 Technologies:

VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) are used to segregate traffic for different departments like HR, Sales, IT, and Voice.
STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) ensures loop-free redundancy at the switch level, preventing broadcast storms.
EtherChannel is implemented between switches for increased bandwidth and fault tolerance by aggregating multiple physical connections into one logical link.
IP Services:

DHCP servers dynamically assign IP addresses to end devices in each VLAN.
DNS servers translate domain names to IP addresses, facilitating communication between internal services.
Security and NAT:

ACLs (Access Control Lists) are used to control traffic between VLANs and secure access to sensitive services.
NAT (Network Address Translation) is implemented for internet-bound traffic to map private IP addresses to public IPs, securing internal networks.
Voice and Video Services:

VoIP technology allows for real-time voice communication between different branches. IP Phones are deployed in each department, and QoS (Quality of Service) ensures priority treatment for voice traffic.
IoT and 4G Connectivity:

IoT devices (such as sensors and cameras) are connected to the network through dedicated VLANs, allowing real-time monitoring and control.
A 4G cellular tower ensures connectivity for IoT devices in remote locations where wired connections are not feasible.
